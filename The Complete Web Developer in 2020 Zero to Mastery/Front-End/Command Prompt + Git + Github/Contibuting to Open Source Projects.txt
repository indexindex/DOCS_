Go to Project Repository;

fork the repository;

clone the repository;

read instructions on repository about getting started with projects;

ideally we create our own branch to work with, 
so for best practice you should make it;

you can now work with project and if you have all set and ready, then...;

do a pull request (master origin mybranch);

both master branch and forked branch now have pull requests in Github;

create a pull request (comment/describe something in a request);

after request have been approved you can delete your branch.
