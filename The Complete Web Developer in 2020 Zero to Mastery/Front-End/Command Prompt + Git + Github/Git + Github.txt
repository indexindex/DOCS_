// Source Control (a way to control/manage files somewhere in a specific location where they are stored)

PUSHING FILES

On a Github you can share your repository files by clicking on a 
"Clone or download" button and from upper-right corner changing to HTTPS. 
After that you will get a link that you can share with teammates;

now in Command Prompt you go to your folder with files;

and in that location you type in "git clone https://...";

you cloned the repository to your folder and now you drag files in there;

we have to access the repository folder and we should get 
(master=) to the right of our folder directory;

to sync my files to Github i have to check my status first 
"git status" and we get notification "Untracked files" - these are the files 
that are not synced yet;

now we need to add them to Github repository: 
"git add index.html";
"git add style.css";
"git add script.js";

doing "git status" again we can see our files that have been added to branch 
and we have new notification "Changes to be committed" - that means we have to commit files;

next command will be "git commit -m"adding starting project"" 
to commit files to Github repository and give that commit a message;

finally we have to push those changes to our repository by giving command "git push".

GETTING FILES

Now in Command Prompt you go to your folder where you want files to be;

you do "git clone https://..." and you cloned the project to your folder;

now that you have downloaded the cloned repository and made some changes to 
files, you can go into that repository and do "git status" to see modified files;

and now that even if we have many files that we want to commit, then we can do it like so:
"git add .";

"git commit -m"changing title";

"git push".

GIT PULL

"git pull" will update your code and even show changes made while the 
file is open in your text editor.
