// TODO: WHAT IS NODE.JS?

/*
    * Node.js is a JS runtime built on Google's
    * open-source V8 JS engine.
    
    * For example, browser is a JS runtime, it executes code within it's own environment.
    * Node.js is also just a JS runtime, that has it's own environment,
    * executing code with V8 engine.
    * V8 engine parses and runs JS code.

    * Node.js opens many possibilities like:
    *    accessing file system;
    *    better networking capabilities.

    * Node.js can be used to build fast, highly scalable network applications.

    * Node.js PROS:
    *    Single-threaded, based on event driven, non-blocking I/O model;
    *    Perfect for building fast and scalable data-intensive apps;
    *    Big companies have started using node in production;
    *    JS across the entire stack: faster and more efficient development;
    *    NPM: huge library of open-source packages available for everyone for free;
    *    Very active developer community.
    
    * Node.js usecases:
    *    API with database behind it (preferably NoSQL);
    *    Data streaming (YouTube, Netflix, ...);
    *    Real-time chat application;
    *    Server-side web application.
    
    * Node.js downsides:
    *    Applications with heavy server-side processing (CPU-intensive), like:
    *        Heavy image manipulations;
    *        Video conversion;
    *        File compression etc.
