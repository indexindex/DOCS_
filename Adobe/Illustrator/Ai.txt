Adobe Illustrator Notes

*	For PRINT specific illustrations use these settings while making a new document: 
		*	Set 'Color Mode' to CMYK;
		*	Set 'Raster Effects' to High (300 ppi);
		*	Set 'Bleed' according to needs (golden standard: 3mm);
		*	!NB When working with text it is reasonable to convert it to outlines, 
			that way it won't cause errors while printing.

*	For WEB specific illustrations use these settings while making a new document: 
		*	Set 'Color Mode' to RGB;
		*	Set 'Raster Effects' to Screen (72 ppi);
		*	No 'Bleed' required.

*	When sending Adobe file to somebody, make sure to outline your text, the other person might
	not have that font on their computer, when text is outlined we have only vector left, not the font-based text.
