// TODO: COMPONENT RUN ORDER (MAIN FLOW)

/*
   * "React" executes "constructor" first because
   * classes always start with them.
   * "render" runs next and contains "HTML" template 
   * for the page to render. "render" also mounts our
   * initial "state".
   * After our "render" mounts the "UI", we run lifecycle method
   * next, for example "componentDidMount". This lifecycle method
   * runs as soon as our component has been mounted to page.
