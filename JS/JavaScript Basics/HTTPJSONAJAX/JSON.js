// JSON (JavaScript Object Notation);

// is a syntax for storing and exchanging data;

// JSON is simply a text, written with JavaScript Object Notation;

// XML is the other option which basically does the same;

// JSON is just more of a standard nowadays (because of similarity towards JS text format);

// JSON has 2 methods for conversion: JSON.parse() which transforms text back into object and JSON.stringify() which does the opposite.
