// TODO: CONFIRM

/*
   * Confirm box is often used to verify or accept something.
   * When Confirm box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed.
   * Option "OK" will return "true" and option "Cancel" will return "false".
   ! Important thing to remember here is that confirm box also blocks the execution of code,
   ! until the confirm box is closed, JS code will not move forward and user might face a blank page.
