/*
    * Templates can be made for specific "HTML" code blocks,
    * for pieces of code that will eventually receive a dynamic data.
    * That data can be inserted into code blocks with the help of placeholders.
    * Placeholders can be any sort of text written in unique pattern, which can be 
    * easily replaced with dynamic data.
