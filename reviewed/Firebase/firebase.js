   * the file "firebase.utils.js".

   * Firestore data pattern: collection (*), document (**), data (***).

   ?          *** name: "Andri"
   ?          *** income: {unit: 4000, currency: "â‚¬"}
   * When creating our database through console by clicking "Create database",
   * it is best to select "Production mode".
   * After database is set up, we should define rules (under Tab "Rules").
   * Rules essentially say who is allowed to change what documents.

   * Back in our "firebase.js", we need to import necessary instances.
   ? "doc" - to retrieve documents from Firestore database (GET DOCUMENT).
   ? "getDoc" - get documents data from Firestore database (GET DATA).
   ? "setDoc" - set documents data to Firestore database (SET DATA).
